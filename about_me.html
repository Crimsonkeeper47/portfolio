<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Zahir McCray. I am a senior graduate at MPVTHS, and a vocationist in Computer Programming and Web Development.</p>
<p>I'm more classed in Python coding, as that is my preferred area of work, but I also do HTML5 and CSS. </p>
<p>I enjoy video games, and im a beta tester in a wip python game.</p>
<p>My favorite subject is math, which is important (not necessary, important.) to coding if you want to understand more about python. </p>
<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
<p>I do some out-of school hobbies outside my usual preference, like bus watching or live-streaming on twitch, I use an Xbox One for my streaming platforms.</p>
<h2>Career Paths</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not know where my career would go after high school, but I am planning on going to a community college for trade or working a small job, so I can stay financially stable.</p>
<p>I am planning on using this vocational knowledge for a side hobby to make money on the side, and decide if I want to progress it more into my main hobby.</p>
<h2>Interests:</h2>
<p>As a python coder, I am interested to see how the program works, and willing to find ways to further improve my knowledge of the program. I also note I am decently known in HTML 5, but I still am working with how to make an efficient webpage.</p>
